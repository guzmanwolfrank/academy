## 1. What exactly are futures contracts and how do they differ from stocks?
A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific asset at a predetermined price on a future date. Unlike stocks where you own a piece of a company, futures contracts are obligations to trade commodities, financial instruments, or other assets at a future date. They're primarily used for hedging risk or speculating on price movements.

## 2. How much money do I need to start trading futures?
Trading futures requires a margin account, typically with a minimum of $500-$10,000, though this varies by broker. However, it's recommended to start with more capital to accommodate potential losses and margin requirements. Remember that futures trading involves substantial leverage, which can amplify both gains and losses.
